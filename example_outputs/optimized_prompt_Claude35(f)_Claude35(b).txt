Training step 1. Epoch 0: : 1it [01:25, 85.58s/it]

Read the PDF file and extract the following parameters for each single-phase high-entropy alloy: name, nominal_composition, measured_composition (if available), lattice_constant (in angstroms, or None if absent), phases, alloy_condition, and doi (if available). Extract the parameters primarily from the text of the PDF. Figures and tables may be used to support the extraction, but the primary source of information should be the text. For multi-phase alloys, report that the alloy is multi-phase and list the constituent phases, but do not include them in the main output. The output should be in JSON format for each single-phase alloy identified.
TF-IDF Cosine Similarity: 0.4733

Training step 2. Epoch 0: : 2it [03:11, 97.69s/it]

Read the PDF file and extract the following parameters for each high-entropy alloy: name, nominal_composition, measured_composition (if available), lattice_constant (in angstroms, or None if absent), phases, alloy_condition, and doi (if available). Extract the parameters from both the text of the PDF and supporting figures and tables. If conflicting information exists, clearly indicate the source and explain the discrepancy.

Consider an alloy single-phase if a single phase constitutes at least 95% of its composition as reported in the paper. For multi-phase alloys, list all phases with their relative abundance and include them in the output with a flag indicating multi-phase status.

Represent nominal and measured compositions as molar ratios (e.g., Al1.0Co1.0Cr1.0Fe1.0Ni1.0). If a parameter cannot be determined with confidence, indicate 'Not Available' and state the reason (e.g., 'information not provided in the text or figures').

The output should be in the following JSON format for each alloy:

{
    "name": "AlloyName",
    "nominal_composition": "Element1A.BCElement2X.YElement3Z...",
    "measured_composition": "Element1P.QElement2R.SElement3T...",

    "alloy_condition": "condition",
    "doi": "DOI",

}

Include all alloys mentioned in the paper, regardless of their phase composition.

Training step 2. Epoch 0: : 3it [04:02, 80.78s/it]

Read the PDF file and extract the following parameters for each high-entropy alloy mentioned in the paper:

1. name
2. nominal_composition (in atomic percentages)
3. measured_composition (in atomic percentages, or "Not Available" if absent)
4. lattice_constant (in angstroms, rounded to 3 decimal places, or "Not Available" if absent)
5. phases (list all identified phases)
6. phase_abundances (for each phase, report percentage if available and >5%, otherwise "Not Available")
7. alloy_condition
8. doi (if available, otherwise "Not Available")
9. is_single_phase (true if one phase constitutes â‰¥95% of composition, false otherwise)

Extract parameters from both text and supporting figures/tables. If conflicting information exists between text and figures/tables, prioritize text data and note the discrepancy.

Report all numerical values to 2 decimal places unless otherwise specified. If a parameter cannot be determined with confidence, use "Not Available" and briefly explain why.

The output should be in the following JSON format for each alloy:
